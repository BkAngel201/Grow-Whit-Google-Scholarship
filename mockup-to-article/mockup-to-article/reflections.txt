You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  


* What new skills have you learned?

Actually i have been playing with HTML for a while so was very easy for me, but is my first time working with other people design so this was intresting and very intructive.

* What has been easy?

Almost every codding part.

* What has been difficult?
  
i dont think it was difficult but was a little bit different, cause i never do the html from another people design, so this was new and fun.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
